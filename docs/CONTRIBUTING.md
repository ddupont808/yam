Thanks for wishing to help! Here there are some guidelines and information about the development process. 

Issues are tracked on GitHub. We use [**a label system** (borrowing from haveno)](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno/issues/50) and GitHub's [project boards](https://github.com/ddupont808/yam/projects) to simplify development. Make sure to take a look at those and to follow the priorities suggested.

## General guidelines

- Be verbose. Remember this is collaborative development and we need to make life as easy as possible for future developers and for the current maintainers.
- All formatting needs to be consistent with the current code.
- Changes must be done 'the right way'. No hacks to make things work, if you are having issues, let the other devs know, so that we can help you out.

## Development process

When you have something new built for Haveno, submit a pull request for review to be merged.

- Pull requests should contain as many details as possible about what you are going to change and why. Avoid "title only" PRs, unless they are self-explanatory.
- Pull requests should contain one single commit, unless it makes sense to have more. Please become familiar with git if you are not.
- Pull requests won't be merged before 24 hours has passed. This timeframe will be extended when Haveno will have more active developers.

## Developer guide

See the [developer guide](developer-guide.md) to get started developing Haveno.
